The dashboard is thoughtfully organized into four distinct sections to provide a complete picture of insurance performance:
1. **Home:** An overview.
2. **General View:** Monthly revenue, customer data, and percentage changes.
3. **Sales Mode Analysis:** Breakdown of sales methods across various months and customer segments.
4. **Age Group Analysis:** Detailed customer segmentation by age for a more granular analysis.

### Key Features
